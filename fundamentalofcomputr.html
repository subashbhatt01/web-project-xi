                <P>
                    Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as an input from the user and
                    processes
                    it under the control of a set of instructions (called program), produces a result (output), and
                    saves it for future use. It is rightly called a Data Processor because it can store, process and
                    retrieve data as and when desired. The fundamental concept of Turings design is the stored
                    program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory.

                    Computer systems and input/output devices. A computer system is a collection of
                    hardware and software components that work together to perform a specific task. Input/output devices
                    are used to interact with the computer system. Examples of input devices include keyboard, mouse,
                    scanner, microphone, and camera. Examples of output devices include monitor, printer, and speaker.

                <p>
                    Software refers to a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. It is a collection of
                    programs, data, and instructions that tell the computer how to perform specific tasks. Software can
                    be classified into two categories: system software and application software. System software is
                    responsible for managing the computer's resources and providing a platform for application software
                    to run. Examples of system software include operating systems, device drivers, and utility programs.
                    Application software is designed to perform specific tasks or solve specific problems. Examples of
                    application software include word processors, spreadsheets, and web browsers.

                <p>
                    An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and
                    provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of
                    system software in a computer system. It acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the
                    user. It provides a platform for other software to run on and manages the computer's resources such
                    as memory, processing power, and storage .

                <p>
                    Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed and marketed
                    by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. For example, Windows
                    NT for consumers, Windows Server for servers, and Windows IoT for embedded systems. Defunct Windows
                    families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone.

                    Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other
                    open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and
                    tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance,
                    though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google.
