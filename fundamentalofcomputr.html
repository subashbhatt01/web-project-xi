                            processes
                            it under the control of a set of instructions (called program), produces a result
                            (output),
                            and
                            saves it for future use. It is rightly called a Data Processor because it can store,

                        <p>
                            Software refers to a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. It is a collection
                            of
                            programs, data, and instructions that tell the computer how to perform specific tasks.
                            Software
                            can
                            be classified into two categories: system software and application software. System software
                            is
                            responsible for managing the computer's resources and providing a platform for application
                            software
                            to run. Examples of system software include operating systems, device drivers, and utility
                            programs.
                            Application software is designed to perform specific tasks or solve specific problems.
                            Examples
                            of
                            application software include word processors, spreadsheets, and web browsers.

                            An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources
                            and
                            provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is the most important

                            of
                            system software in a computer system. It acts as an interface between the computer hardware

                            the
                            user. It provides a platform for other software to run on and manages the computer's

                            NT for consumers, Windows Server for servers, and Windows IoT for embedded systems. Defunct
