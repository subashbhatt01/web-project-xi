    <h1>Programming Concept and Logics</h1>
    <p>Programming is the process of designing and building computer programs. It involves writing code that tells a
        computer what to do. Programming concepts are the fundamental ideas that underlie all programming languages.
        These concepts include variables, data types, control structures, functions, and objects. Understanding these
        concepts is essential for writing effective code.</p>

    <p>Programming logic is the process of designing a program's flow of control. It involves breaking down a problem
        into smaller parts and designing algorithms to solve those parts. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for
        solving a problem. They are used to implement programming logic. Good programming logic involves breaking down a
        problem into smaller parts that can be solved independently and then combining those parts to solve the larger
        problem.</p>

    <p>Programming languages are used to write computer programs. There are many programming languages available, each
        with its own syntax and features. Some popular programming languages include Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript.
        Choosing the right programming language depends on the task at hand and the programmer's experience level.</p>


    <h2>C programming </h2>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie1. It is widely
            used and influential1. C is a powerful language that can be used to develop software like operating systems,
            databases, compilers, and so on2. It is also an excellent language for beginners to learn programming2.

            C programming involves writing code that tells a computer what to do. The language features cleanly reflect
            the capabilities of the targeted CPUs1. C has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers,
            protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software1.</p>
